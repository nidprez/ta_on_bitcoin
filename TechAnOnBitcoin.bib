abstract = {Blockchain technology, and more specifically Bitcoin (one of its foremost applications), have been receiving increasing attention in the scientific community. The first publications with Bitcoin as a topic, can be traced back to 2012. In spite of this short time span, the production magnitude (1162 papers) makes it necessary to make a bibliometric study in order to observe research clusters, emerging topics, and leading scholars. Our paper is aimed at studying the scientific production only around bitcoin, excluding other blockchain applications. Thus, we restricted our search to papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, whose topic is “bitcoin”. This database is suitable for such diverse disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. This bibliometric study draws the landscape of the current state and trends of Bitcoin-related research in different scientific disciplines.},

However the mean-reverting technical trading rules do offer significant returns, even after controlling for data-snooping, risk, transaction costs and out-of-sample testing. Therefore our results add to the literature by showing that mean-reverting technical trading rules offer substantial predictive power in SRI indices, but traditional trend-following rules offer very little predictive power.},

abstract = {This study examines whether investors can predict returns on cryptocurrency. There has been much debate about whether returns on financial assets such as stock returns or commodity returns are predictable; how-ever, very few studies have investigated cryptocurrency return predictability. We focus on bitcoins, the most popular cryptocurrency, in the analysis. We divide the domain of daily bitcoin returns into 21 intervals and aim to predict in which of these intervals the next day return will be. We develop a return-predictor/model using 124 technical indicators that are based on bitcoin's historical prices only. We then conduct an out-of-sample performance analysis of a trading strategy based on the model and a buy-and-hold strategy over the period January 2012–December 2017. We find evidence of the bitcoin return predictability and that the proposed trading strategy outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy under the information ratio. These results indicate that a combination of big data and technical analysis helps predict bitcoin returns that are not driven by fundamentals. This finding has important implications for researchers and investors in the bitcoin market.},

Furthermore, the models' predictive ability was evaluated using Diebold-Mariano test and Hansen's Model Confidence Set. The analysis was reiterated for both low and high frequency data. Results showed that SVR-GARCH models managed to outperform GARCH, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models with Normal, Student's t and Skewed Student's t distributions. For all variables and both time frequencies, the SVR-GARCH model exhibited statistical significance towards its superiority over GARCH and its extensions.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of deep learning in cryptocurrency prediction. The results from testing the existence of nonlinearity revealed that the time series of all digital currencies exhibit fractal dynamics, long memory and self-similarity. The predictability of long-short term memory neural network topologies (LSTM) is significantly higher when compared to the generalized regression neural architecture, set forth as our benchmark system. The latter failed to approximate global nonlinear hidden patterns regardless of the degree of contamination with noise, as they are based on Gaussian kernels suitable only for local approximation of non-stationary signals. Although the computational burden of the LSTM model is higher as opposed to brute force in nonlinear pattern recognition, eventually deep learning was found to be highly efficient in forecasting the inherent chaotic dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.},

Bitcoin has achieved only scant consumer transaction volume, with an average well below one daily transaction for the few merchants who accept it. Its volatility is greatly higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, imposing large short-term risk upon users. Bitcoin's daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with widely used currencies and with gold, making bitcoin useless for risk management and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge. Bitcoin prices of consumer goods require many decimal places with leading zeros, which is disconcerting to retail market participants. Bitcoin faces daily hacking and theft risks, lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts.

abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {The next major wave of Bitcoin regulation will likely be aimed at financial instruments, including securities and derivatives, as well as prediction markets and even gambling. While there are many easily regulated intermediaries when it comes to traditional securities and derivatives, emerging bitcoin-denominated instruments rely much less on traditional intermediaries. Additionally, the block chain technology that Bitcoin introduced for the first time makes completely decentralized markets and exchanges possible, thus eliminating the need for intermediaries in complex financial transactions. In this article we survey the type of financial instruments and transactions that will most likely be of interest to regulators, including traditional securities and derivatives, new bitcoin-denominated instruments, and completely decentralized markets and exchanges. We find that Bitcoin derivatives would likely not be subject to the full scope of regulation under the Commodities and Exchange Act to the extent such derivatives involve physical delivery (as opposed to cash settlement) or are nonfungible and not independently traded. We also find that some laws, including those aimed at online gambling, do not contemplate a payment method like Bitcoin, thus placing many transactions in a legal gray area. Following the approach to virtual currencies taken by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, we argue that other financial regulators should consider exempting or excluding certain financial transactions denominated in Bitcoin from the full scope of their regulations, much like private securities offerings and forward contracts are treated. We also suggest that to the extent that regulation and enforcement becomes more costly than its benefits, policymakers should consider and pursue strategies consistent with that new reality, such as efforts to encourage resilience and adaptation.},

In this paper we extend the “superior predictive ability” (SPA) test of Hansen (2005, JBES) to a stepwise SPA test that can identify predictive models without potential data snooping bias. It is shown analytically and by simulations that the stepwise SPA test is more powerful than the stepwise Reality Check test of Romano and Wolf (2005, Econometrica). We then apply the proposed test to examine the predictive ability of technical trading rules based on the data of growth and emerging market indices and their exchange traded funds (ETFs). It is found that technical trading rules have significant predictive power for these markets, yet such evidence weakens after the ETFs are introduced.},

abstract = {We propose a new test for superior predictive ability. The new test compares favorably to the reality check (RC) for data snooping, because it is more powerful and less sensitive to poor and irrelevant alternatives. The improvements are achieved by two modifications of the RC. We use a studentized test statistic that reduces the influence of erratic forecasts and invoke a sample-dependent null distribution. The advantages of the new test are confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical exercise in which we compare a large number of regression-based forecasts of annual U.S. inflation to a simple random-walk forecast. The random-walk forecast is found to be inferior to regression-based forecasts and, interestingly, the best sample performance is achieved by models that have a Phillips curve structure.},

This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},

When such data reuse occurs, there is always the possibility that any satisfactory results obtained may simply be due to chance rather than to any merit inherent in the method yielding the results. This problem is practically unavoidable in the analysis of time-series data, as typically only a single history measuring a given phenomenon of interest is available for analysis. It is widely acknowledged by empirical researchers that data snooping is a dangerous practice to be avoided, but in fact it is endemic. The main problem has been a lack of sufficiently simple practical methods capable of assessing the potential dangers of data snooping in a given situation. Our purpose here is to provide such methods by specifying a straightforward procedure for testing the null hypothesis that the best model encountered in a specification search has no predictive superiority over a given benchmark model. This permits data snooping to be undertaken with some degree of confidence that one will not mistake results that could have been generated by chance for genuinely good results.},

This has earned plenty of coverage in the media but surprisingly not in the academic literature. We therefore fill this knowledge gap. We conduct an econometric investigation of the existence of bubbles in the bitcoin market based on a recently developed technique that is robust in detecting bubbles – that of Phillips et al.
